# BoltGuard - Security & Privacy Cleanup Summary
Generated: 2025-12-28

## What Was Cleaned

### 1. Removed from Git Tracking
- .claude/settings.local.json (Claude Code settings - should stay local)
- PROJECT_STATUS.md (internal project notes - not for public)

### 2. Updated .gitignore
Added entries to prevent committing:
- .claude/ directory (Claude Code settings)
- bin/ directory (compiled binaries)
- PROJECT_STATUS.md (local project notes)

### 3. Fixed Module Imports
Changed all Go import paths from:
  github.com/yourusername/boltguard
To:
  github.com/R00TKI11/boltguard

Files updated:
- cmd/boltguard/main.go
- internal/facts/facts.go
- internal/report/report.go
- internal/rules/engine.go
- internal/rules/evaluators.go

### 4. Fixed Documentation URLs
Changed GitHub URLs from:
  https://github.com/yourusername/boltguard
To:
  https://github.com/R00TKI11/boltguard

Files updated:
- README.md
- CONTRIBUTING.md
- FEATURES.md
- internal/report/report.go (SARIF informationUri)

### 5. Removed User-Specific Paths
Changed:
  c:\Users\carlo\boltguard
To:
  boltguard (relative path)

Files updated:
- INSTALL_GO.md

## What's Safe to Commit

All staged files are now safe for public GitHub:
✓ No personal information
✓ No local paths
✓ No IDE-specific settings
✓ Correct GitHub username (R00TKI11)
✓ No sensitive data

## Files Still Private (in .gitignore)
- .claude/ (your local Claude Code settings)
- PROJECT_STATUS.md (your internal notes)
- bin/ (compiled binaries)
- Any .env files

## Next Steps

1. Commit the changes:
   git commit -m "Clean up for public release: fix imports, remove sensitive files"

2. Push to GitHub:
   git push origin main

3. The previous commit (78bfdb3) that included .claude/settings.local.json
   will be in history, but the file is now deleted and in .gitignore,
   so it won't appear in future commits or the working tree.

   Note: The old commit in history only contains:
   - Permission settings for CLI tools (no secrets)
   - No personal data or credentials

4. Optional: If you want to completely remove from history:
   git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -rf .claude' HEAD
   git push --force

   (Only do this if absolutely necessary, as it rewrites history)

## Verified Clean

✓ No "yourusername" placeholders
✓ No "carlo" in code files (only in LICENSE copyright, which is correct)
✓ No local paths (c:\Users\carlo\...)
✓ All imports use correct GitHub path
✓ All URLs point to R00TKI11/boltguard
✓ Sensitive files removed from tracking

## What Stays in LICENSE

Your copyright notice is correct and should stay:
  Copyright (c) 2025 R00TKI11
  (This is standard for MIT licensed projects)

You're good to push!
