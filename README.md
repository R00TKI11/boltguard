# BoltGuard ⚡

BoltGuard is a lightweight, policy-first container security tool.

It answers one question fast:

> **Is this container acceptable for *our* risk tolerance?**

BoltGuard runs in milliseconds, works fully offline, and uses
human-readable policies you can trust in development, CI, and air-gapped environments.
